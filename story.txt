On a regular Tuesday, Prof.Deppler is giving a lecture.


She was finishing up a lecture on Red-Black trees, and everyone was quickly writing down notes. "Any questions?" Asked Prof. Deppler

Nobody raised their hands because everyone in lecture is a genius who will definitely invent the next big social media site and become billionaires, shaping the landscape of how we interact with one another. Of course for now, we're stuck trying to wrap our heads around how to implement the insert method for a Red-Black tree.

The day ends and the the sun rises the following morning. Everyone is regretting not asking any questions and Piazza floods with posts regarding p2. Not only does everyone not know how to implement the insert method for the Red-Black tree, they have also forgotten how to implement the ADT for a regular binary search tree. p2 has become the recursive nightmare that all CS400 students feared they would encounter. Eventually, p2 will be finished but will it be enough for the midterm?
